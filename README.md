# 📊 Student Exam Score Analysis using NumPy

This project demonstrates how to analyze student exam scores using **NumPy**. It covers core NumPy operations such as calculating mean, median, standard deviation, variance, identifying top performers, and much more — all applied to a simple real-world dataset.

## 🧠 What This Project Does

- Calculates **average scores** in Math, English, and Science
- Finds the **student with the highest and lowest total scores**
- Computes **variance** and **standard deviation** for subjects
- Retrieves the **median score** in English
- Lists **total scores** per student
- Counts **students scoring >90 in Science**
- Checks how many **passed all subjects** (pass mark = 40)
- Identifies the **top 3 students** based on total score

## 🧮 Technologies Used

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

## 💡 Dataset

Each row in the NumPy array represents a student's scores in:

| Math | English | Science |
|------|---------|---------|
| 85   | 78      | 92      |
| 76   | 88      | 85      |
| ...  | ...     | ...     |

There are **20 students** and **3 subjects** in total.

```
--Average Scores--
Math:  79.75
English:  77.25
Science:  81.1

Student with Highest Total Score: 279
Student with lowest total score:  19

Variance in Science: 75.89
Median in English: 77.5

Total Students who scored greater than 90 in Science: 4
Number of students passed in all 3 subjects: 20

Top 3 performers are:  [9 4 18]
--Total Scores--
9 = 279
4 = 275
18 = 275
```
